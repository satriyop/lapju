Average Progress (Mean Completion Per Task)
Definition: The arithmetic mean of all task progress percentages that have been recorded. Formula: Sum of all task percentages / Number of tasks with progress Example: If you have 3 tasks with 25%, 50%, and 100% progress, Average Progress = (25 + 50 + 100) / 3 = 58.3% Why it's important for project management:
Work intensity indicator: Shows how much work has actually been done on tasks that have started
Early warning system: If average is low (e.g., 20-30%), many tasks are barely started - potential bottleneck
Resource allocation: High average (80%+) but low completion rate means tasks are "almost done" but stalled - may need focused push to finish
Quality insight: Very high average with perfect distribution suggests methodical progress; scattered averages may indicate unbalanced workload



Completion Rate (Tasks 100% Complete)
Definition: Percentage of total leaf tasks that have reached 100% completion. Formula: (Number of 100% completed tasks / Total leaf tasks) × 100 Example: 50 out of 222 leaf tasks are at 100% → Completion Rate = 22.5% Why it's important for project management:
Actual deliverables: Shows how many work items are truly finished and can be "checked off"
Revenue recognition: In construction (your domain), completion rate often ties to payment milestones
Risk assessment: Low completion rate late in project = high risk of delays
Client reporting: Most meaningful metric for stakeholders - "How much is actually done?"
Forecasting: Helps predict project end date based on completion velocity


Key Differences & When Each Matters
Scenario	Average Progress	Completion Rate	What It Means
High Avg, Low Completion	85%	15%	Many tasks nearly done, but not finishing - bottleneck at final stages
Low Avg, High Completion	30%	40%	Some tasks fully done, others barely started - unbalanced execution
High Both	90%	85%	Project is healthy, nearing completion
Low Both	25%	5%	Early stage or serious delays
For construction projects, Completion Rate is more meaningful because each completed task represents actual physical work that can be inspected and verified, while Average Progress can be subjective.
